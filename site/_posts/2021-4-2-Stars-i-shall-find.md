*Stars I Shall Find* was originally a commission from Auckland Choral to write a piece for their 100th year Passchendaele Memorial Concert in 2017. Using Sara Teasdale's *There will be rest*, Sarah created a choral landscape representing the stars and using them to find piece. 
Since the commission, it has been revised for SATB choir and piano. The score is available for purchase from SOUNZ.
