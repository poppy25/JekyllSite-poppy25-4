*The Tides of Remembrance* (2019-2021) is a piece written in dedication to the memory of the victims of the tragic terrorist attacks that took place in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15, 2019. The piece for choir, chamber orchestra, piano and percussion, focuses on the loss and tragedy within a community but also emphasizes the importance of optimism and unity of a society in light of tragedy. Sarah communicates the importance of this within her piece by using texts from The Requiem Mass, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardernâ€™s speeches in order to symbolize community within her work. This is a central theme within her repertoire as a composer, where she explores external forces that affect society and the human psyche.

The Tides of Remembrance was premiered in 2021 at Sarah Fouhy's BFA Graduation Recital.
