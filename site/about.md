Sarah Fouhy (b. 1999) is a composer from Auckland, New Zealand. She began her career as a composer while she was still residing in Auckland, where she received a commission from Auckland Choral in 2017, after placing first in the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestraâ€™s National High School Composition Competition in 2016. 

Sarah graduated from California Institute of the Arts in 2021 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Music Composition. Her inspiration is drawn from her own life experiences and environments around her, and she explores external forces that affect society and the human psyche. Sarah primarily composes for choir, orchestra, chamber ensembles and soloists. During her time in the USA she studied under Nick Deyoe, Michael Jon Fink, Karen Tanaka and Sara Cubarsi. Sarah has had World Premiers in both New Zealand and the USA, and works have been recorded by world-renowned musicians including The Isura String Quartet, Erika Duke-Kirkpatrick, Andrew McIntosh, Derek Stein, and The CalArts Ensemble.  

Sarah is available on an ongoing basis for commissions.
